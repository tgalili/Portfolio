# Projects:

### [Python Fantasy Football Prediction](https://github.com/tgalili/Fantasy_Football_Points_Prediction)
* The purpose of this project is to research and apply various machine learning regression algorithms to predict fantasy football points for the 2024 NFL season. The models are built using historical player statistics and team dynamics.
* The data, sourced from a SQLite database, is preprocessed to handle missing values and is then analyzed to summarize the main characteristics of the variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between different features, such as player age, team performance, and position.
* Engineered features from the data include a 3-game rolling average of fantasy points, binary indicators for exceptional performance, and normalized team performance metrics. These features are used to enhance the predictive power of the models.
* The models explored in this project include Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the features are scaled for better model performance. Both models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to identify the best performing model.
* Model performance is visualized through actual vs predicted points plots and residuals distribution plots. Feature importance for the Random Forest model is also analyzed.
* The final models and scaler are saved using pickle for future use. The best model is identified based on its accuracy and performance metrics on the validation set.

### [Yahoo StockData API - REST API Using Java/SpringBoot/Maven/MonogDB](https://github.com/Sawmonabo/StockData)
*  The application is able to fetch stock data from the YahooFinance API on any ticker provided by user input, as well as, storing data to a MongoDB database. 
*  CRUD operations to and from the MongoDB database.
*  Spring Boot and Maven are used to manage dependencies and jumpstart the project.
*  Integration of Service/Model/Application packages to provide clarity for class usage.
*  Java OOP and encapsulation methods used.
*  Usage of a MultiValueMap hashSet.
